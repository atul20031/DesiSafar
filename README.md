Travel Destination  Hybrid Recommendation System [Python + PyWebIO + Flask + Heroku]

Combined Recommender.ipynb - This file contains the script of various baselines models that we have for our travel recommendation system. These models uses various techniques such as TF-IDF, CountVectorizer etc. to find similarities between places and recommend the places based on these similarities.

Efficient Query Processing - This is a script to train the autoencoders and reduce the whole vocabulary to a very small latent space which helps us process the query faster.

Procfile - file required for hosting the application on Heroku platform

app.py - This is the main file from which the application is running.

detailed dataset.csv - This dataset can is used for rvaluation of our recommender system by checking the tags of the destinations recommended.

final_dataset_wo_duplicates.csv - This file contains the dataset the has been created by scraping various travel websites and contains tourist places related to India.

requirement.txt - This file contains the various modules and its specific version that our application requries to run on the hosted server.

runtime.txt - This file containns various runtime specific constraint that is required to host our travel recommendation system platform on Heroku

Note: All .pkl file are few details/data dumped for some models to speed up the processing time of various scripts/model.
